# Forgewright Ralph Loop

## Mission
Complete Phase 1 of Forgewright: Ship v0.1.0 to npm.

## Context
Read specs/ for project context and market positioning.
Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for the full task list.

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Ship v0.1.0

## Instructions

1. Pick the first uncompleted task from Phase 1 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. Implement it completely
3. Test that it works
4. Mark the task as done with [x]
5. Commit with a descriptive message

## Rules

- Focus only on Phase 1 tasks (shipping v0.1.0)
- Run tests before committing: `bun test`
- Run typecheck before committing: `bun run typecheck`
- Commit after every completed task
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Do not modify Phase 2+ tasks

## Completion

When ALL Phase 1 tasks are marked [x], output:

<promise>PHASE1_DONE</promise>

This signals the first phase is complete and Forgewright is published.
